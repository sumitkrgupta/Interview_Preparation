Event Sourcing:
Scenario: You are designing a system where events are crucial for maintaining state across microservices. How would you implement event sourcing in Java to ensure consistency and traceability?

Containerization:
Scenario: Your team has decided to use Docker containers for deploying microservices. How would you containerize a Java microservice, and what benefits does containerization bring to the microservices architecture?

API Gateway:
Scenario: Explain the role of an API gateway in a microservices architecture, and how would you implement it using Java-based technologies?

Scaling Microservices:
Scenario: One of your microservices is experiencing high traffic, and you need to scale it horizontally. Describe the strategies and tools you would use to scale a Java microservice.

Security:
Scenario: Security is a top concern for your microservices. How would you implement authentication and authorization for Java microservices, considering the distributed nature of the architecture?

Monitoring and Logging:
Scenario: You want to ensure effective monitoring and logging of your Java microservices. What tools and practices would you employ to achieve comprehensive visibility into the system's behavior?

Polyglot Persistence:
Scenario: Each microservice has its unique data storage requirements. How would you implement polyglot persistence in a Java microservices ecosystem, and what factors would you consider when choosing databases for different services?
